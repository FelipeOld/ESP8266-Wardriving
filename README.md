# ESP8266 Wardriving
A compilation of scripts and resources for wardriving on the [ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266), including data visualization tools in Jupyter Notebook.

Documentation on this page is still in development.

## Components
Any ESP8266-based board should work with the basic required components, but the D1 mini form factor is highly recommended since using modules (such as for SD logging + battery management) can be done using plug-and-play hardware in a small footprint. All linked components are D1 mini compatible. 

**Required Components:**
| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ESP8266 | Gather WiFi data & control hardware modules
| SD Reader | Store data that we can analyze with WiGLE / Python |
| GPS Module | Grab geolocation data + timestamp |

**Optional Components:**
| Component | Purpose | 
| --- | --- |
| 128x64 OLED | Get a visual display of WiFi data being captured |
| LiPo Battery | Power your ESP8266 for portable applications |
| Battery Module | Manage power for your ESP8266 w/ a LiPo battery |
| 100K Î© Resistor | Optional to read in battery level w/ the D1 Mini |
   
## Hardware Setup

**SD Reader Module** 
| SD Reader Pin | ESP8266 GPIO | D1 Mini Pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V | 5V |
| MISO | GPIO12 | D6 |
| MOSI | GPIO13 | D7 |
| SCK | GPIO14 | D5 |
| CS | GPIO15 | D8 |

If you are using SD card shield and intend to use OLED display in this stack I strongly recommend disconnect data pins D1 to D4 to connect OLED and GPS modules directly to Wemos D1 mini. This avoid strange behaviors like dont receive data from GPS or dont send any data to display and misconnect through SD card shield.

**GPS Module** 
| GPS Pin | ESP8266 GPIO | D1 Mini Pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VCC | 5V | 5V |
| TX | GPIO2 | D4 |
| RX | GPIO0 | D3 |

**OLED display** 
| GPS Pin | ESP8266 GPIO | D1 Mini Pin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VCC | 3.3V | 3.3V |
| SCL | --- | D1 |
| SDA | --- | D2 |
